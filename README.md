# Bento Portfolio Concept v1

Inspired by a clean and light gray and white color palette reminiscent of the Apple Store, with a little playfulness in the form of dark non-neutral colors, micro-animations with Framer Motion and Tailwind transitions, and overall styling using Tailwind. Project bootstrapped using create-next-app.
